# xml-manipulation
This is a small program I wrote to take a specific xml file and do two things.
The first one was to create a function that will add up the value of all &lt;ghosts> in the file.
A second function was created to do add up the value of all &lt;ghosts> as well as all &lt;connections>.
This time, the data will be stored in a dictionary instead of a variable.
